## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS
- BEM notation
- Vite

### What I learned

First project made on my own without following any toutorial. During the project I learned how to:

- start a new project with Vite and Sass
- add responsive images, depending on screen size and pixels density
- prepare for starting the project with analysing Figma files

It is also worth noticing, that I improved my CSS and SCSS skills and I will be more confident, when I will start a new project next time.

### Continued development

In the future project I would like to still improve my frontend skills. I would like to practice more Sass concepts like mixins, functions and flow control rules.
